# M58CafeMenuBoard
A collection of scripts and documentation regarding our Cafe Menuboard Digital Signage system powered by Wordpress, UZBL and a Raspberry Pi.


This is my attempt to document all of the moving pieces involved in our Digital Signage solution.  This project currently consists of the following pieces:

- A Raspberry Pi 2 with a 16gb SD card running Raspbian OS.
- UZBL browser running on the PI in a terminal session in full screen mode with no desktop environment.
- A Wordpress installation running on a local ESXi Server which is serving content to the PI as well as to external clients.
- A 70in Vizio TV to display the content.
- A collection of scripts to better manage content and display.

This repository includes all of the custom configuration files needed for everything to work, as well as all of the scripts that are being used to manage content and the Raspberry Pi/TV.
